# Supervised Learning in Python with Scikit-learn Library

We will explore the implementation of common supervised learning algorithms in Python by using scikit-learn library. Below is the list of algorithms that we will explore:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines
- Multiclass Classification

Then, there will be a case of Natural Language Processing utilizing supervised learning in the last section
